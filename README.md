# Employees_Burnout_analysis-and-Prediction
Description:
This project aims to analyze and predict employee burnout using machine learning techniques. Employee burnout is a critical issue in many workplaces and can lead to decreased productivity, increased turnover rates, and negative impacts on employee well-being. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to identify patterns and factors contributing to burnout and develop predictive models to anticipate and prevent burnout among employees.
